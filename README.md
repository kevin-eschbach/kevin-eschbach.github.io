# This is my personal website and my blog
This repository is automatically deployed as a static site by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Whenever I push to this repository,
the site is automatically build and deployed.

Having Jekyll build a static site is a great way to host a blog, since it's 
lightweight and fast. Websites nowadays are often bloated with JavaScript and
other resources, which makes them slow to load. Having just a bunch of HTML and
CSS is sufficient for a blog or personal website. It also makes the site more
accessible for people with disabilities, since it doesn't rely on JavaScript to
render the content.
